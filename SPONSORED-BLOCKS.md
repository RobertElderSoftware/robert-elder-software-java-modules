#  SPONSORED BLOCK DEDICATION

Last updated August 31, 2025:

This document describes the nature of the agreement for any custom 'sponsored blocks' in the associated 'Block Mining Simulation Game'.

From time to time, Robert Elder Software may offer sales of 'sponsored block types' where enthusiasts of
the 'Block Mining Simulation Game' can offer financial support in exchange for having a moniker of their choice appear
as a 'dedication' that will be permanently associated with a given 'block' that appears in the 'Block Mining Simulation Game'.
The precise monetary terms of such an agreement are defined elsewhere on a case by case basis.

Currently, all sponsored block types must represent a natural mineral that occurs in nature that has an identifiable CAS Registry number (eg. Pyrite, CAS# 1309-36-0).
Once a given block type has been sponsored, it can never be sponsored again by anyone else.  Block sponsorships are awarded on a first come first serve basis.

If you make a pledge to sponsor a custom block type, be aware that the following terms apply:

-  Your recorded 'dedication' in the game is permanent and will be publicly viewable forever in the help menu and other places throughout the game.  If you'd like your dedication to be anonymous, you can simply use the moniker 'anonymous' or another pseudonym of your choosing.  Sponsoring a block type also grants you a license to play the game under the 'Robert Elder Software Proprietary License'.
-  Sponsoring a custom block type does NOT grant you any interest, title, or claim to any aspect of the game.  It is effectively just an acknowledgement and thank you for supporting the project.
-  Robert Elder Software Inc. reserves the right to refuse or remove any monikers that are deemed offensive or obscene.
